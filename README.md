*DEPRECATED*

This is a UNICODE-based game engine that outputs visual data to the Windows Powershell in a Visual Studio environment. Repo includes a couple of instances of the game engine. To run the instances, open their  *.sln* files in their respective folders and click *"Start Without Debugging"* in the Visual Studio environment.

UPDATE:

Unfortunately, the console game engine is now deprecated. Although I do have plans to restore it in the future, the visual data outputted to the terminal in the Visual Studio environment is scrambled for some reason. Nontheless, much of the code in the *WindowsGameEngine_abs_1.h* is still very much useful for understanding how text-based game engines work.
